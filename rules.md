# X-Team 08 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks



## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Create a GroupMe and keep in contact.
Try to get at least two team members meeting up in person per week to discuss progress.
Notify other group members if you are unable to meet at the specified time.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Encourage pair programming on more difficult tasks.
Review each others work throughout the week.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Each group member should finish their assigned parts by an agreed upon deadline. We will try the github projects tool to keep track of things that are in progress/done.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Each Monday communicate with the group so everyone knows upcoming due dates and their responsibilities to get work done.
