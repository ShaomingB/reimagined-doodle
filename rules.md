# X-Team 08 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Create a GroupMe and keep in contact.
Try to get at least two team members meeting up in person per week to discuss progress.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Encourage pair programming on more difficult tasks.



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed



## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
